### Playing with JavaScript Consol
* Hello World! <br> <!-- In JavaScript Consol -->
  ```
  alert("Hello World!")
  ```
  > Make a pop up in that tab and says "Hello World!"

* 
  ``` 
    let js = 'amazing'
    if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')
  ```
  > Make a pop up in that tab and says "JavaScript is FUN!"

* 
  ``` 
    js = 'boring'
    if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!')
  ```
  > Nothing happens.

* We can also perform mathematical operations on it: <!-- Can use consol as a calculator -->
  ``` 
    40+8+23-10
  ```
  > Prints answer {61} in consol.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a `High-Level`, `Object-Oriented`, `Multi-Paradigm` programming language.
 > A `Programming Language` is basically just a tool that allows us to write code that will instruct a computer to do something.
 
 > JavaScript is a `High-Level` language, which means that we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
 
 > JavaScript is `Object-Oriented`, which means that the language is based on the concept of objects for storing most kinds of data.
 
 > JavaScript is also a `Multi-Paradigm` language, which means that it's so flexible and versatile, that we can use all kinds of different programming styles, such as imperative and declarative programming. And these different styles are just different ways of structuring our code.
